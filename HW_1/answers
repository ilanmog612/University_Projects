1) we think that manully it would take about 3-4 minutes to scan a pgae. So to scan 30 pages is would take about 2 hours.

2)Our conclusions are: 
a) we think that if you want to scan a page for information it is easier to write a script that is doing it for you instead of copying pasting ect.
b) Another type of work that we can use our new knowledge in is error tracking and managing. we can parse different error logs created by our app and printing out valuable information.

3) If we would want to run this script evrey hour we would do the following
a) Go to the website once again using wget (in case some information changed during the last hour).
b) GEt an updated players files.
c) Run the script with the new players file. 

If we would want the proccess above to be executed automatically  we would write another script that executes the script above once an hour. It will be synced with the clock on the computer.

We would create a database that contains all the known players. we will add a filter to our script that will prevent the script from searching again for the players that are already in the database.
